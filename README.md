# Arxiv Redirector

Arxiv Redirector streamlines your arXiv browsing by auto-redirecting external links to your chosen default view: Abstract, PDF, or HTML. In case the HTML version is not available from arXiv, it will re-direct you to arXiv vanity automatically.

## Features

* **Automatic Redirection:** Choose your default viewing preference once and let Arxiv Redirector handle the rest.
* **HTML Fallback:** In cases where the HTML version of a document isn't available on arXiv, Arxiv Redirector automatically redirects you to arXiv Vanity for a seamless browsing experience.
* **Support for Chrome and Firefox:**  Available for both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers.
* **Installation:** Arxiv Redirector can be installed from the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons page:
